/**
 * Makes the longbow's arrow fly faster without touching its draw time.
 *
 * <p>MMS wants the longbow to read as a sniping weapon: same slow pull, but a
 * far flatter, quicker shot than a plain bow. {@code projectileVelocity} is a
 * private final constructor argument shared by every {@code CustomBow} — the
 * slingshot included — so rather than rewrite the field this intercepts the two
 * places it is read and substitutes a higher number for the longbow only.
 *
 * <p>Both reads have to move together. {@code releaseUsing} multiplies it by
 * the pull progress to get the launch speed, while {@code shootProjectile}
 * <em>divides</em> the ranged-damage attribute by it before calling
 * {@code setBaseDamage}, because vanilla multiplies base damage back out by the
 * arrow's actual speed on impact. The two cancel exactly, which is what keeps
 * damage pinned to the 12 set in {@code WeaponTuning} no matter what velocity
 * is used here. Bumping only one of them would silently rescale damage.
