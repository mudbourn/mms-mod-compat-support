/**
 * Registry and shared rules for weapons MMS makes throwable.

 * throw is entirely ours: a tag decides which items can be thrown, an item
 * mixin gives those items trident-style use behaviour, and {@link
 * ThrownWeaponEntity} carries them through the air.
 *
 * <p>The membership tag is deliberately data-driven rather than an
 * {@code instanceof PikeItem} check. Basic Weapons generates its pike variants
 * from material packs — tin and bronze exist only because a pack added them —
 * so a class check would be right today and wrong the moment a pack lands. It
 * also means adding hammers later is a one-line data change with no rebuild.
