/**
 * Draws a thrown weapon as its own item model, oriented along its flight path.
 *
 * <p>The model is resolved in {@link ItemDisplayContext#NONE}. That choice is
 * load-bearing for Basic Weapons: its client item definitions switch on display
 * context, mapping {@code gui}/{@code ground}/{@code fixed}/{@code on_shelf} to
 * the flat sprite and everything else to the 3D held model. {@code NONE} lands
 * in the "everything else" fallback and carries no display transform of its own,
 * so we get the real geometry in a clean frame rather than a model pre-rotated
 * for someone's hand.
 *
 * <p>The orientation constants below are the part that has to be checked by
 * eye — the two flight rotations are vanilla's, but the correction that turns
 * "item model as authored" into "point-first along travel" depends on which axis
 * a given model was built along, and no amount of reading the JSON substitutes
 * for watching one fly.
